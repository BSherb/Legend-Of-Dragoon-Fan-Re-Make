# Legend-Of-Dragoon-Fan-Re-Make
This will be a fairly long project for anyone to contribute to, so long as adjustments/suggestions are justified and fit the lore/game. Keep in mind most stats/items are being pulled 1:1 from the game with minor changes in names. Animations and level design wont be taking place until the framework is complete for everything else. Please note that this will be utilizing full 3D, not using overlayed 2D backgrounds/foregrounds to create a false sense of 3D. None of this will be truly discussed or worked on until development reaches that point.
